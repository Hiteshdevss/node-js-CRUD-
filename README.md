# Project: CRUD Operations with Node.js

This project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js. It provides an API to interact with a database for managing resources.

## Features

- **Create:** Allows users to add new resources to the database.
- **Read:** Fetches existing resources from the database.
- **Update:** Modifies existing resources in the database.
- **Delete:** Removes resources from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd project-crud-nodejs
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=<mongodb_connection_string>
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## API Endpoints

- **GET /resources:** Fetches all resources.
- **GET /resources/:id:** Fetches a specific resource by ID.
- **POST /resources:** Creates a new resource.
- **PUT /resources/:id:** Updates a resource by ID.
- **DELETE /resources/:id:** Deletes a resource by ID.

## Usage

1. Make requests to the API endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client.
2. Ensure to include appropriate request payloads for creating and updating resources.
3. Monitor responses for successful or error outcomes.
